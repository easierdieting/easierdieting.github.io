      <p>I am not a qualified doctor, but I was a fellow sufferer struggling to
        lose weight.<br>
        <br>
        Although highly motivated by health issues, over a six month period I
        was unable to lose even one pound with typical calorie-restriction "Eat
        Less, Move More". <br>
        <br>
        There were two specific medical issues why I couldn't succeed, but
        rather than attempt to discover why I was struggling and how I could be
        helped, a healthcare professional merely suggested my willpower was in
        question.<br>
        <br>
        Not only is my negative experience with a healthcare professional far
        from unusual, but I found medical information online which explains why
        "Eat Less, Move More" is not a viable long-term weight loss strategy for
        the majority of people.<br>
        <br>
        I also found other medical information which made a good case for the
        safety and efficacy of Low Carbohydrate diets. I was then able, via a
        strict Low Carbohydrate (Ketogenic) diet, to lose three stone (19kg) in
        just seven months, significantly reduce my Cardiovascular risk and
        reverse/put into remission Prediabetes, all without feeling starved or
        deprived!<br>
        <br>
        There seems to be so much contradictory and even dubious information on
        weight-loss from all quarters (amateurs, qualified health professionals
        and in the media) that I wanted to add my voice to those talking what
        seems sense, is based on credible research and agrees with the personal
        experience of many.<br>
        <br>
        I am not attempting to give medical advice, but just some helpful
        information. I realise that there are practical reasons why Low Carb
        won't be right for everyone, but I would like to encourage others and
        give them the same opportunity I had.<br>
        <br>
        I do not profit financially or in kind from this website, but if a few
        people find hope and help from these pages then I will have accomplished
        my goal.</p>
