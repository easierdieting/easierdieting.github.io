      If you have read <a href="widsh.html" style="color: #009000;">Why is
        Dieting so HARD?</a> you will have learnt that appetite and weight loss
      are governed by hormones, which are not subject to willpower. Also,
      calorie restriction introduces its own problems as the body then
      progressively becomes more efficient in response to the apparent food
      shortage (metabolic slowdown). In order to increase your chances of being
      successful, dieting needs to be done in a way that avoids such problems:<br>
      <br>
      A Low Carbohydrate or (simply Low Carb) diet is something that I and many
      others have found gets around the physiological/hormonal problems
      associated with calorie-restricted diets.<br>
      <br>
      <u>But I've read negative comments about Low Carb diets from dieticians,
        doctors and in research studies!</u><br>
      <p>So have I! The studies I've come across which come to negative
        conclusions about Low Carb diets weren't actually looking at Low Carb or
        weren't conducted properly: they mostly included a somewhat lower carb
        (but still high carb) diet, or were effectively a type of
        calorie-restricted diet.</p>
      <p>I suspect dieticians and doctors have only seen such studies when they
        make comments about there being no good evidence for Low Carb being
        either effective or safe. (There is actually plenty of good evidence, as
        we shall see.) It is also evident from some of the negative comments
        that dieticians and doctors make about Low Carb that they aren't
        acquainted with either the definition of a genuine Low Carb diet, nor
        the basic principles behind why it works. (I gather the average European
        GP has had about 24 hours training in nutrition, probably none of which
        was about actual Low Carb.)</p>
      <p>An example of a negative study: In August 2018 there were numerous
        press reports saying a 25-year US study showed that Low Carb diets can
        shorten life expectancy. In the study paper, the "Low Carb" group had a
        median (average) of energy from carbohydrate of 37%. Assuming the
        subjects ate 2000 calories daily, that makes 185g of carbohydrate. This
        is far too high even to be considered Liberal Low Carb (typically
        50-100g, but usually at most 130g), so the paper was incorrect to say it
        had produced a result relevant to Low Carb diets. (There were also
        issues about the way the study was conducted, and with the statistical
        analysis, which imply the conclusions of the paper should not be given
        much credence.)</p>
      <p>A genuine Low Carbohydrate diet consists of restricted carbohydrate,
        adequate protein plus mono/saturated fat and usually doesn't include
        calorie counting. (A Ketogenic diet is less than 20g carbohydrate per
        day, Moderate Low Carb is 20-50g per day and Liberal is 50-100g. Fibre
        passes right through the body, so isn't counted.) A Low Carb diet is
        also known as a Low Carb High Fat (or simply LCHF) diet.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><u>High Fat? Is that safe?</u></p>
      <p>For decades now we have been told how eating saturated fat is bad for
        us and causes increased blood cholesterol and heart problems or
        cardiovascular disease. Happily for us, that advice isn't based on good
        science...</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">​<u>That sounds far-fetched!</u></p>
      <p>Nina Teicholz spent nine years doing background research and analysing
        the relevant US dietary research studies published since the 1950s, and
        found that the US dietary guidelines against saturated fat have not been
        supported by good science. (The US lead against saturated fat has merely
        been adopted by many countries, including the UK.) She published her
        findings in the 2014 book The Big Fat Surprise, which has received
        positive appraisal in more than a dozen scholarly review papers,
        including The Lancet. The piece in The Lancet Vol 390 August 19, 2017
        titled “Fat and heart disease: challenging the dogma” says “ … readers
        might be incredulous at some of Teicholz’s claims and want to check the
        references. When many of those papers are read again from a more
        critical perspective, the angst and anger will rise.” i.e.: what Nina
        claims in her book can be verified, and realising how for decades we
        have been given incorrect advice about diet and saturated fat will
        produce anger and angst.</p>
      <p>Not only this, but high carbohydrate consumption appears to be the real
        culprit for causing obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>There are a growing number of physicians who recognise that errors were
        made in the past about dietary advice and that, sadly, people are
        reaping the negative consequences health-wise. Even though numerous
        credible studies have either vindicated dietary saturated fat, or showed
        no link to heart disease, repeatedly the dietary (and treatment)
        guidelines have not been updated. (Also, I can hardly imagine the legal
        fallout if in America health officials said “We got the advice about
        dietary saturated fat and carbohydrate wrong. We apologise to the
        millions of people globally who have suffered needlessly, and to the
        loved ones of those who died, by following our incorrect advice.”) As
        already noted, the UK, among many countries, has simply adopted the US
        lead against dietary saturated fat and continued with it, despite the
        contrary evidence. (<a href="https://www.zoeharcombe.com/2018/07/saturated-fat-consultation-sacn-my-response/"

          style="color: #009000;">This page</a> illustrates a fairly recent
        example of the guidelines not being changed despite the contrary
        evidence and medical professionals realising the guidelines are
        incorrect.)</p>
      <p>For an authoritative account of the underlying physiology which draws
        on many credible research results, and also background info about Low
        Carb, I highly recommend the readable and practical 2011 book <i>The
          Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living</i> by Jeff S. Volek PhD RD
        &amp; Stephen D. Phinney MD PhD. (There is also a brief history about
        the incorrect anti-fat guidelines and an explanation of why some
        negative Low Carb studies aren't credible.) At the time the book was
        published, the suitably qualified authors (RD = Registered Dietician, MD
        = Medical Doctor) together had five decades of clinical and research
        experience in the field of nutrition and had published hundreds of
        research papers.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">​<u>Why is a Low Carb diet better able to
          manage those pesky hormones?</u></p>
      <p>Here are just three reasons:</p>
      <p>​1) Eating carbohydrate (and especially wheat) causes hormonal hunger
        responses for more carbohydrate. Reducing your carbohydrate intake
        diminishes your hunger pangs.</p>
      <p>​2) A diet which includes more fat is satisfying so the satiety hormone
        leptin is managed, too. Again, fewer hunger pangs.</p>
      <p>​3) Eating Carbohydrate causes an increase in blood glucose, which (in
        people without Type 1 Diabetes) causes a proportional release of insulin
        from the pancreas. The hormone insulin then either makes the glucose
        energy available to muscle cells or stores it as fat. Less insulin from
        less carbohydrate means less fat is stored and allows existing body fat
        to be used up. (Despite fat having a higher caloric value per gram than
        carbohydrate, most people tend to find that their bodies respond quite
        differently to calories when less insulin is being produced, and this
        enables easier weight-loss.)</p>
      <p>​Some people come across Low Carb because they became pre-diabetic
        (like myself) or have Type 2 Diabetes. However, it can still be a good
        weight-loss approach even if you have not been so diagnosed. (I have
        seen estimates that in the US, perhaps 50% of obese people over 40 have
        pre-diabetes, but are unaware of it.) Also, Insulin Resistance, which
        causes pre-diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes, makes weight-loss extremely
        difficult but Low Carb improves Insulin Resistance and so aids
        weight-loss.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">​<u>What about the Environment?</u></p>
      <p>​People are rightly concerned about the environment, so how can we
        square this with red meat and dairy consumption? Done correctly, raising
        grass-fed cows can actually result in net carbon capture and be positive
        for the environment. (For example, see <a href="http://www.eatwild.com/"

          style="color: #009000;">www.eatwild.com</a> and look at the
        Environmental Benefits section.) Beef and butter (e.g. Kerrygold butter)
        from grass-fed animals is also tastier and more nutritious than the
        grain-fed alternative.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">​<u>What's the catch?</u></p>
      <p>​You have probably realised by now that a Low Carb diet is rather
        counter-cultural, both socially and in medical terms. Firstly, eating
        out or socially is harder and more restricted, but not impossible.
        Secondly, much (but not all) of the medical profession seem anti-Low
        Carb and unaware of the science behind it, although there are exceptions
        and Low Carb seems to be gaining more approval as the past mistakes
        about fat and carbohydrate are being realised and accepted.</p>
      <p>​Also, there are few convenience foods that are Low Carb, so more
        cooking/food preparation is required. On the plus side, there are online
        resources (including recipes) and support available (e.g. online forums)
        which are free and make a huge difference. Low Carb requires some
        learning and understanding, but people who try it find there is a good
        chance of being successful at losing weight and improving their health.</p>
