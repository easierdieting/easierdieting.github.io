      <p style="text-align: center;"><u>What now?</u></p>
      <p>On this website I have given a broad introduction to Low Carb diets and
        why they can be helpful and why they make sense medically.</p>
      <p>On the second anniversary of me being Low Carb, I wrote <em>My Low
          Carb Journey Back to Health</em>, an account which gives my personal
        narrative and includes more details of medical and practical aspects of
        Low Carb, plus other sources of information. The pdf document can be
        downloaded <a href="My%20Low%20Carb%20Journey%20Back%20to%20Health.pdf"
          style="color: #009000;">here</a>.</p>
      <p>To accompany <em>My Low Carb Journey Back to Health</em> I have
        compiled an information sheet called <em>Practical Tips for following a
          Low Carb or Ketogenic Diet</em>. It also includes links to excellent
        free online sources of Low Carb information. The pdf document can be
        obtained <a href="Practical%20Tips%20for%20following%20a%20Low%20Carb%20or%20Ketogenic%20Diet.pdf"
          style="color: #009000;">here</a>.</p>
      <p>You might have specific questions or issues, even after reading all the
        information available on this website and the two pdf documents
        mentioned above. The Diabetes Community <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/"
          style="color: #009000;">www.diabetes.co.uk</a> isn't restricted to
        only those with Diabetes or Prediabetes, and is highly recommended,
        especially their Low-Carb Diet and Ketogenic forums. The forum community
        is informative, supportive and participation is free. The Low Carb
        Programme app from diabetes.co.uk, which requires a subscription, has
        been endorsed by the UK NHS.</p>
      <p>Other Sources of Useful Low Carb Info:</p>
      <p>Diet Doctor at <a href="https://www.dietdoctor.com/" style="color: #009000;">www.dietdoctor.com</a>
        has good, clear guidance from qualified physicians on what you should or
        should not eat with Low Carb or Ketogenic diets and has a good selection
        of Low Carb/Keto recipes. I found many of their videos are actually
        available for free on YouTube and The Diet Doctor Podcasts are highly
        informative.</p>
      <p>Already mentioned: For an authoritative account of the underlying
        physiology which draws on many credible research results, and also
        background info about Low Carb, I highly recommend the readable and
        practical 2011 book <em>The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living</em>
        by Jeff S. Volek PhD RD &amp; Stephen D. Phinney MD PhD. (There is also
        a brief history about the incorrect anti-fat guidelines and explanation
        of why some negative Low Carb studies don't pass muster.) At the time of
        book publication, the suitably qualified authors (RD = Registered
        Dietician, MD = Medical Doctor) together had five decades of clinical
        and research experience in the field of nutrition and had published
        hundreds of research papers.</p>
      <p>Dr David Unwin, a senior GP from Southport, and his wife Dr Jen Unwin
        (a Consultant Clinical Psychologist) had a paper published in early 2014
        entitled <em>Low carbohydrate diet to achieve weight loss and improve
          HbA1c in type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes: experience from one general
          practice</em> which includes helpful patient advice (see Box 1. Advice
        sheet for patients) and is available <a href="https://www.practicaldiabetes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2016/03/Low-carbohydrate-diet-to-achieve-weight-loss-and-improve-HbA1c-in-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-diabetes-experience-from-one-general-practice.pdf"
          style="color: #009000;">online</a>. (Worth carrying a printout to give
        to members of the medical profession who are skeptical about Low Carb.)</p>
      <p>Dieting needs to be done safely, and therefore under appropriate
        medical supervision. Although the GP I saw wasn't familiar with the
        science behind Ketogenic diets nor terribly keen on them, he was still
        happy to keep tabs on my progress via blood tests: lipids (HDL, LDL and
        Triglycerides), HbA1c, liver and kidney function etc. These blood tests
        showed that, apart from losing weight, a Low Carbohydrate diet had
        enabled me to reduce my cardiovascular risk and reverse Prediabetes. </p>
      <p>Finally, I wish you well in your quest to improve your health.</p>
