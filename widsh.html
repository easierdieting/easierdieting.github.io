                number of aspects of weight-loss, including appetite and
                fat-storage, are governed by hormones and those hormones are not
                subject to "willpower". Further, it has been shown that even
                after nearly two years of calorie restriction, the hormones
                constantly screaming at you to eat something are just as loud -
                it doesn't get any easier. Trying to fight against such strong
                natural drives by mind-over-matter isn't a viable long-term
                strategy, but it's even harder than that for another
                understandable medical reason:<br>
                <br>
                ​A 1919 US medical book entitled <em>A Biometric Study of Basal
                  Metabolism in Man</em> showed that calorie restriction
                inevitably leads to a comparable metabolic slowdown: the body is
                responding to the reduced food intake by reducing how many
                calories it uses. (This is a bodily strategy for keeping you
                alive during a food shortage. The trouble is that your body has
                no means of knowing that the food shortage is deliberate!) Even
                if weight loss is initially successful, calorie restriction will
                become less and less effective until weight loss grinds to a
                halt. Then calorie restriction is essential just to avoid weight
                gain. Many people who have tried such dieting can relate to that
                experience!<br>
                <br>
                ​Studies have borne out the effects of such difficulties. One
                showed that the long-term success rate of "Eat Less, Move More"
                (losing 20 pounds and keeping it off for two years) for people
                with obesity is 2%. (Other similar studies for generally
                overweight people fare no better.) If you are simply in the 98%
                or so for whom calorie-restriction isn't a viable long-term
                weight loss strategy, that really isn't your fault! Rather,
                oversimplifying weight loss to "Eat Less, Move More" is where
                the fault lies.<br>
                <br>
                ​From what we have seen, it should be noted that e.g. “A Calorie
                is a Calorie” is an oversimplification which proves to be
                inaccurate (and unhelpful) since the body can react differently
                at different times to the same Calorie!<br>
                <br>
                ​Sadly, however, many healthcare professionals are adamant that
                "Eat Less, Move More" is correct and that those for whom it
                doesn't work are either somehow weak or obstinate. Such
                professionals aren't deliberately being mean to patients – they
                are merely following their flawed training, but it does seem
                rather unfair on the poor patient!<br>
                <br>
                ​Conclusion: Hormones govern aspects of weight-loss and they are
                not subject to willpower. Also, the body is complex and reacts
                to calorie-restriction, making "Eat Less, Move More" a poor
                long-term weight-loss strategy.<br>
