    <h2 style="font-weight: lighter; text-align: center; width: 100%;">​In a
      word: HORMONES!</h2>
    <div style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;font-size: 1.2em; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">
      A number of aspects of weight-loss, including appetite and fat-storage,
      are governed by hormones and those hormones are not subject to
      "willpower". Further, it has been shown that even after nearly two years
      of calorie restriction, the hormones constantly screaming at you to eat
      something are just as loud - it doesn't get any easier. Trying to fight
      against such strong natural drives by mind-over-matter isn't a viable
      long-term strategy, but it's even harder than that for another
      understandable medical reason:<br>
      <br>
      ​A 1919 US medical book entitled <em>A Biometric Study of Basal
        Metabolism in Man</em> showed that calorie restriction inevitably leads
      to a comparable metabolic slowdown: the body is responding to the reduced
      food intake by reducing how many calories it uses. (This is a bodily
      strategy for keeping you alive during a food shortage. The trouble is that
      your body has no means of knowing that the food shortage is deliberate!)
      Even if weight loss is initially successful, calorie restriction will
      become less and less effective until weight loss grinds to a halt. Then
      calorie restriction is essential just to avoid weight gain. Many people
      who have tried such dieting can relate to that experience!<br>
      <br>
      ​Studies have borne out the effects of such difficulties. One showed that
      the long-term success rate of "Eat Less, Move More" (losing 20 pounds and
      keeping it off for two years) for people with obesity is 2%. (Other
      similar studies for generally overweight people fare no better.) If you
      are simply in the 98% or so for whom calorie-restriction isn't a viable
      long-term weight loss strategy, that really isn't your fault! Rather,
      oversimplifying weight loss to "Eat Less, Move More" is where the fault
      lies.<br>
      <br>
      ​From what we have seen, it should be noted that e.g. “A Calorie is a
      Calorie” is an oversimplification which proves to be inaccurate (and
      unhelpful) since the body can react differently at different times to the
      same Calorie!<br>
      <br>
      ​Sadly, however, many healthcare professionals are adamant that "Eat Less,
      Move More" is correct and that those for whom it doesn't work are either
      somehow weak or obstinate. Such professionals aren't deliberately being
      mean to patients – they are merely following their flawed training, but it
      does seem rather unfair on the poor patient!<br>
      <br>
      ​Conclusion: Hormones govern aspects of weight-loss and they are not
      subject to willpower. Also, the body is complex and reacts to
      calorie-restriction, making "Eat Less, Move More" a poor long-term
      weight-loss strategy.<br>
