        Do you struggle to lose weight? You are not alone!
        <p>Do you feel you have no-will power to lose weight? You are not alone!</p>
        <p>Do you manage to lose some weight, but then put it all back on again
          plus a little bit more? You are not alone!</p>
        <p>Have you been criticised when "Eat Less, Move More"
          calorie-restriction failed? Again, you are not alone!</p>
        <p>For decades, we have been told that "Eat Less, Move More" is the
          correct way to manage weight, and that if it doesn't work for you then
          YOU are the one at fault.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1em;"><strong>WRONG!</strong></p>
        <p>There are actually sound medical reasons why "Eat Less, Move More" is
          not a viable long-term weight-loss strategy for the majority of
          people.</p>
        <p>I was a fellow sufferer. Although highly motivated by health issues,
          over a six month period I was unable to lose even one pound with
          typical calorie-restriction. A healthcare professional suggested my
          willpower was in question, when in fact there were two specific
          medical issues why I couldn't be successful.</p>
        <p>However, I found information online which enabled me, via a strict
          Low Carbohydrate (Ketogenic) diet, to lose three stone (19kg) in just
          seven months, significantly reduce my Cardiovascular risk and
          reverse/put into remission Prediabetes, all without feeling starved or
          deprived!</p>
        <p>I would like to share some of what I have learnt, and some sources of
          free helpful online information, to encourage others and give them the
          same opportunity I had. </p>
        <p>I hope that you will feel better about yourself and more hopeful
          after reading <a href="widsh.html" style="color: #009000;">Why is
            Dieting so HARD?</a></p>
